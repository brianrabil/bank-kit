# Project Structure Guide

- The project is organized into `apps/` (for applications), `packages/` (for shared libraries and components), and root-level configuration.
- Each app and package has its own `package.json` and `tsconfig.json`.
- Shared UI components are in `packages/ui/`.
- Documentation lives in `apps/docs/`.
- Use the appropriate directory for new features or components.
