# React & UI Component Guidelines

- Always use shadcn components where possible.
- Favor named exports for components.
- Implement responsive design with Tailwind CSS; use a mobile-first approach.
- Prefer defining components with `function` instead of `const`.
- Prefer typing component props with an interface before the component declaration.
- Prefer using shadcn theme classNames (e.g., `text-foreground`, `text-muted`, `border-border`, etc.) where possible.
- Use "motion/react" instead of "framer-motion".
- Use declarative JSX.
- Use Shadcn UI and Tailwind for components and styling.
