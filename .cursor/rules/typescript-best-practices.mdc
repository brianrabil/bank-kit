# TypeScript Best Practices

- Use the `function` keyword for pure functions.
- Use descriptive variable names with auxiliary verbs (e.g., `isLoading`, `hasError`).
- Use TypeScript for type safety and always annotate types where possible.
- Use valid TSDoc comments to document functions and components.
- Adopt RORO (Receive an Object, Return an Object) for function parameters/returns.
- Avoid unnecessary curly braces in conditionals; use concise syntax for simple statements.
- Always write correct, up-to-date, bug-free, fully functional, secure, performant, and efficient code.
- Focus on readability over performance.
- Fully implement all requested functionality.
