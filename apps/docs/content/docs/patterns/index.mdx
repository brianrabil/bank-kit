# Advanced Patterns

Bank Kit UI includes pre-built patterns for common financial workflows, allowing you to quickly implement complex features without starting from scratch. These patterns are designed to be customizable, accessible, and compliant with financial industry standards.

## Pattern Categories

Bank Kit UI provides patterns in the following categories:

### [Authentication Patterns](/docs/patterns/authentication)

Authentication patterns provide secure and user-friendly ways to handle user identity in financial applications. These patterns include login forms, registration flows, password reset processes, and two-factor authentication implementations.

### [Dashboard Patterns](/docs/patterns/dashboard)

Dashboard patterns offer structured layouts for displaying financial information, analytics, and user-specific data. These patterns include analytics dashboards, admin interfaces, user dashboards, financial overviews, and activity feeds.

### [Form Patterns](/docs/patterns/form)

Form patterns simplify the creation of complex financial forms with features like multi-step workflows, dynamic field generation, and guided form completion. These patterns include multi-step forms, dynamic forms, form wizards, search interfaces, and filter interfaces.

### [Data Management Patterns](/docs/patterns/data-management)

Data management patterns provide structured approaches to handling financial data operations. These patterns include CRUD interfaces, data import/export functionality, bulk actions, data visualization, and report generation.

### [Communication Patterns](/docs/patterns/communication)

Communication patterns facilitate user interaction and information exchange within financial applications. These patterns include chat interfaces, notification centers, comment systems, feedback forms, and support ticket systems.

## Using Patterns

Patterns in Bank Kit UI follow a modern composition-based approach, similar to TanStack and Shadcn UI. Each pattern is built using a combination of primitive components and hooks that can be composed together to create complex functionality.

### Pattern Composition

Patterns are composed using a combination of:

1. **Primitive Components**: Base UI components that serve as building blocks
2. **Compound Components**: Components that combine multiple primitives
3. **Hooks**: Custom hooks that provide state management and business logic
4. **Context Providers**: Context providers that share state across components
5. **Utilities**: Utility functions for common operations

### Example: Authentication Pattern

Here's an example of how the authentication pattern is composed:

```tsx
import { 
  useAuth, 
  AuthProvider, 
  LoginForm, 
  RegistrationForm, 
  PasswordResetForm 
} from "@bank-kit/ui/patterns/authentication";

// Wrap your application with the AuthProvider
export default function App({ children }) {
  return (
    <AuthProvider>
      {children}
    </AuthProvider>
  );
}

// Use the authentication pattern in your components
export default function AuthenticationPage() {
  const { isAuthenticated, user, login, register, resetPassword } = useAuth();
  
  return (
    <div className="container mx-auto py-8">
      <h1 className="text-2xl font-bold mb-6">Authentication</h1>
      
      {!isAuthenticated ? (
        <div className="space-y-8">
          <LoginForm onSubmit={login} />
          <RegistrationForm onSubmit={register} />
          <PasswordResetForm onSubmit={resetPassword} />
        </div>
      ) : (
        <div>
          <p>Welcome, {user.name}!</p>
          {/* Protected content */}
        </div>
      )}
    </div>
  );
}
```

## Customizing Patterns

All patterns in Bank Kit UI are built with customization in mind. You can modify the appearance, behavior, and functionality of patterns to match your application's requirements:

### Using Context Providers

Patterns often use context providers to share state and functionality across components:

```tsx
import { 
  DashboardProvider, 
  useDashboard 
} from "@bank-kit/ui/patterns/dashboard";

// Wrap your dashboard with the DashboardProvider
export default function DashboardPage() {
  return (
    <DashboardProvider>
      <DashboardContent />
    </DashboardProvider>
  );
}

// Use the dashboard pattern in your components
function DashboardContent() {
  const { data, isLoading, error, refresh } = useDashboard();
  
  if (isLoading) return <div>Loading...</div>;
  if (error) return <div>Error: {error.message}</div>;
  
  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Dashboard</h1>
      {/* Dashboard content */}
      <button onClick={refresh}>Refresh</button>
    </div>
  );
}
```

### Using Hooks

Patterns provide hooks that encapsulate complex logic and state management:

```tsx
import { 
  useFormWizard, 
  FormWizardProvider 
} from "@bank-kit/ui/patterns/form";

// Wrap your form with the FormWizardProvider
export default function LoanApplicationPage() {
  return (
    <FormWizardProvider>
      <LoanApplicationForm />
    </FormWizardProvider>
  );
}

// Use the form wizard pattern in your components
function LoanApplicationForm() {
  const { 
    currentStep, 
    steps, 
    goToNextStep, 
    goToPreviousStep, 
    isFirstStep, 
    isLastStep,
    formData,
    updateFormData
  } = useFormWizard();
  
  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Loan Application</h1>
      <div className="mb-4">
        Step {currentStep + 1} of {steps.length}
      </div>
      
      {/* Render the current step */}
      {steps[currentStep].component}
      
      <div className="flex justify-between mt-4">
        {!isFirstStep && (
          <button onClick={goToPreviousStep}>Previous</button>
        )}
        
        {!isLastStep ? (
          <button onClick={goToNextStep}>Next</button>
        ) : (
          <button onClick={() => console.log(formData)}>Submit</button>
        )}
      </div>
    </div>
  );
}
```

## Best Practices

When implementing patterns in your financial application, consider the following best practices:

1. **Composition Over Inheritance**: Use composition to build complex patterns from simple components.
2. **Separation of Concerns**: Separate UI components from business logic using hooks and context providers.
3. **Type Safety**: Use TypeScript to ensure type safety across your application.
4. **Accessibility**: Ensure all patterns are accessible to users with disabilities.
5. **Responsive Design**: Test patterns across different device sizes and orientations.
6. **Performance**: Monitor and optimize pattern performance, especially for data-intensive operations.
7. **Compliance**: Ensure patterns meet regulatory requirements for financial applications.
8. **Error Handling**: Implement comprehensive error handling for all patterns.
