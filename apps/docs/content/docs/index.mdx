# Welcome to Bank Kit UI

Bank Kit UI is a comprehensive component library built on top of Shadcn UI, designed specifically for enterprise financial applications. It provides a consistent, accessible, and customizable design system that can be used across the Bank Kit ecosystem.

## Why Bank Kit UI?

Bank Kit UI accelerates the development of financial applications by providing:

- **Enterprise-Grade Components**: Pre-built, production-ready components for financial workflows
- **Compliance-Ready**: Built with regulatory compliance considerations for financial services
- **Security-Focused**: Components designed with security best practices for financial applications
- **Accessibility Compliance**: Built on Radix UI primitives with full ARIA support and WCAG 2.1 compliance

- **Theme Support**: Built-in light and dark mode support with customizable theming
- **Modular Architecture**: Import only what you need to minimize bundle size

## Quick Start

You can get started with Bank Kit UI in just a few steps:

1. **Install** the `@bank-kit/ui` package:

   ```bash
   # Using bun
   bun add @bank-kit/ui

   # Using npm
   npm install @bank-kit/ui

   # Using yarn
   yarn add @bank-kit/ui

   # Using pnpm
   pnpm add @bank-kit/ui
   ```

2. **Import the global styles**:

   ```typescript
   // app/globals.css
   import "@bank-kit/ui/globals.css";
   ```

3. **Use the Shadcn Registry**:

   Bank Kit UI uses the Shadcn registry for component management. No manual Tailwind CSS configuration is required as the library handles all styling internally.

4. **Implement components**:

   ```tsx
   import { Button } from "@bank-kit/ui/components/button";
   import { Card, CardContent, CardDescription, CardFooter, CardHeader, CardTitle } from "@bank-kit/ui/components/card";

   export default function AccountSummary() {
     return (
       <Card>
         <CardHeader>
           <CardTitle>Account Balance</CardTitle>
           <CardDescription>Your current account balance</CardDescription>
         </CardHeader>
         <CardContent>
           <p className="text-3xl font-bold">$1,234.56</p>
         </CardContent>
         <CardFooter>
           <Button>View Details</Button>
         </CardFooter>
       </Card>
     );
   }
   ```
