# Installation

Welcome to the Installation guide for **Bank Kit**! In this section, you’ll learn how to install the necessary packages, configure Tailwind CSS, and verify everything is working correctly in your local development environment.


### 1. Clone or Create a Monorepo

Bank Kit is designed to work in a **Turborepo** or **any** monorepo setup. If you’d like to use the provided structure:

1. **Clone** the Bank Kit repository (or use it as a reference):

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourorg/bank-kit.git
cd bank-kit
```

2.	Install dependencies (for instance, using Bun):

```bash
bun install
```

Or if you prefer npm or yarn, run the equivalent command.

If you already have a monorepo, you can simply install the Bank Kit packages where you need them (see below).

---

2. Install Bank Kit Packages

Bank Kit includes several packages under the packages/ directory:
-	@bank-kit/ui: The core UI library with banking-related components.
-	@bank-kit/registry: Shadcn registry for generating or syncing components.
-	@bank-kit/typescript-config: Shared TypeScript configuration (optional).

If you need just the core UI library, install @bank-kit/ui:

```bash
bun add @bank-kit/ui
# or
npm install @bank-kit/ui
# or
yarn add @bank-kit/ui
```

### 3. Configure Tailwind CSS

Because Bank Kit uses Tailwind CSS for styling, make sure your Tailwind config is set up to scan the correct paths. For example, in a Turborepo structure, your tailwind.config.js might look like this:

```js copy
// tailwind.config.ts
module.exports = {
  content: [
    "./apps/**/*.{js,ts,jsx,tsx,mdx}",
    "./packages/**/*.{js,ts,jsx,tsx,mdx}",
    // Add more paths as needed
  ],
  theme: {
    extend: {},
  },
  plugins: [],
}
```

This ensures Tailwind will generate the necessary utility classes for the Bank Kit components (which might reside in packages/ui or packages/registry).

### 4. Shadcn Registry (Optional)

If you plan to use Shadcn’s registry-based workflows for scaffolding or updating components, you’ll need to ensure the @bank-kit/registry package is installed and configured. Then you can run commands like:

From the repo root or the registry package directory:
```bash copy
npm run registry:build
```
```bash copy
yarn registry:build
```
```bash copy
bun run registry:build
```

These commands typically call shadcn build under the hood to sync or generate components defined in your .json registry files (found in apps/docs/public/r/ in the default repo layout).

### 5. Verify Installation
	1.	Link or import your UI library in a test component:

```ts
// apps/docs/pages/test.tsx
import { Button } from "@bank-kit/ui/components/button"

export default function TestPage() {
  return (
    <div className="p-4">
      <Button>Click Me!</Button>
    </div>
  )
}
```

	2.	Run your dev server (e.g., in the apps/docs folder if using the provided Next.js app):

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
bun run dev
```


	3.	Open your app in the browser. You should see a styled button, indicating Tailwind and Bank Kit are working correctly.

Troubleshooting

<details>
  <summary><strong>Tailwind Classes Not Applying</strong></summary>
  Double-check that the <code>content</code> array in <code>tailwind.config.js</code> includes <code>./packages/**/*</code> paths, as Bank Kit’s components may reside within <code>packages/ui</code>.
</details>


<details>
  <summary><strong>TypeScript Errors</strong></summary>
  If you encounter TS issues, ensure you are extending the shared <code>@bank-kit/typescript-config</code> (if you want a unified TS config). Also, confirm that <code>typescript</code> is installed in each workspace.
</details>


<details>
  <summary><strong>Registry Build Failures</strong></summary>
  Confirm that <code>shadcn</code> is installed where <code>registry:build</code> is executed. For instance, <code>@bank-kit/registry</code> includes <code>"shadcn": "2.2.0-canary.1"</code>, so ensure dependencies are installed correctly.
</details>
