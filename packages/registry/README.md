# @bank-kit/registry

To install dependencies:

bun install
```

This project was created using `bun init` in bun v1.2.10. [Bun](https://bun.sh) is a fast all-in-one JavaScript runtime.

## Included Components

The registry exposes a small set of foundational UI components sourced from
the `@bank-kit/ui` package:

- **Button** – Primary action button.
- **Card** – Flexible card container with header and footer slots.
- **Input** – Styled text input field.
- **Textarea** – Multi-line text input.
- **Pill** – Animated pill selector.
- **Tabs** – Animated tab switcher.
- **Hello World** – Simple example component.

More components can be added over time by editing `registry.json` and running
`bun run registry:build`.
